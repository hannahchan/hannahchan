## Hi, I'm Hannah

I'm a Software Engineer with Cloud and Infrastructure (DevOps) experience. I currently work for [Endeavour Drinks](https://www.woolworthsgroup.com.au/page/about-us/our-brands/liquor) but honed most of my skills by working in a microservices environment at a company called [MYOB](https://www.myob.com). This is my personal GitHub profile.

I primarily focus on building containerised applications with C# / .NET and deploying it to Kubernetes. I've also built serverless applications with TypeScript and Node.js on AWS and in the front-end space I work with React.

For a breakdown of my skills and interests I've put together a [Tech Radar](TechRadar.md).

In my early career I worked in Enterprise IT.

## About my GitHub

If you're interested in how I think as a software engineer, please checkout my passion project [Scaffold.WebApi](https://github.com/hannahchan/Scaffold.WebApi). I primarily use this project to experiment and learn and it generally represents my current thinking about software. Feel free to look at my other repositories as well however please keep in mind that these maybe incomplete.

### Hi, I'm Hannah

I'm a Software Engineer and currently work with microservices at a company called [MYOB](https://www.myob.com) building web applications and platforms for accountants and accounting practices. This is my personal GitHub profile.

I primarily focus on building containerised applications with C# and .NET Core and deploying it to Kubernetes. I also build serverless applications with Typescript and Node.js on AWS and in the front end space I work with React.

In my early career I worked in Enterprise IT.

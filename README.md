## Hi, I'm Hannah

I'm a Software Engineer with a Cloud and Infrastructure background. I currently work in a microservices environment at a company called [MYOB](https://www.myob.com) building web applications and platforms for accountants and accounting practices. This is my personal GitHub profile.

I primarily focus on building containerised applications with C# and .NET Core and deploying it to Kubernetes. I also build serverless applications with TypeScript and Node.js on AWS and in the front-end space I work with React.

For a breakdown of my skills and interests I've put together a [Tech Radar](TechRadar.md).

In my early career I worked in Enterprise IT.

## About my GitHub

If you're interested in how I think as a software engineer, please checkout my passion project [Scaffold.WebApi](https://github.com/hannahchan/Scaffold.WebApi). I primarily use this project to experiment and learn and it generally represents my current thinking about software. Feel free to look at my other repositories as well however please keep in mind that these maybe incomplete.

## Hi, I'm Hannah

I'm a software engineer with cloud and infrastructure experience based in Sydney and I currently work for [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com) doing stuff to help improve the scalability and performance of Jira Cloud. I have also worked for endeavourX, the tech division of [Endeavour Group](https://endeavourgroup.com.au) and [MYOB](https://www.myob.com). This is my personal GitHub profile.

I primarily focus on building containerised applications in C# / .NET and am currently up-skilling to do this in Java. I have experience in deploying applications to Kubernetes and AWS and have also built serverless applications with TypeScript and Node.js. In the front-end space I have worked with both Angular and React and in the data space, I have exposure to Python and PySpark in Databricks. PostgreSQL is also my preferred database.

In my early career I worked in Enterprise IT.
